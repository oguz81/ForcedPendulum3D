FORCED DAMPED PENDULUM IN 3D WITH REAL-TIME PLOTTING

This is the simulation of a forced damped pendulum in 3D with real-time plotting, made with C++ and OpenGL.

The differential equation of the system is solved with Runge-Kutta 4.

It was made from scratch. No model loading(just loaded coordinate plane as a texture). The sphere and the rod of the pendulum, the grid, lighting the scene, calculating normal vectors of the surfaces of the pendulum etc.. All of them were made with C++ and OpenGL.
